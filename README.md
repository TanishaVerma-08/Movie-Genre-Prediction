# 🎥 Movie Genre Prediction

This project focuses on predicting movie genres based on their overviews using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The analysis is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📋 Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To preprocess and analyze textual data from movie overviews.
- To implement a classification model that predicts movie genres based on their overviews.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and converting textual data into numerical feature vectors.
- **Model Training**: Implementing a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for genre prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
